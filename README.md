I am a phd brazilian student of physiology and I am learnig R programming. Everthing in this world is new to me.
Actually, I study chronobiology. But inside this subject, we study the sleep/wake cycle. So, we study the relations between the sleep patterns and some physical activity aspects. How you can see, my english is not good yet. I am happy to have the oportunity to learn with you. NamastÃª.
